[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-latest%20release-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/fcebron/Terraformate/releases/latest)

The aim of this project is to have a script capable of providing the first system upgrade and install a pre-defined [list of softwares](config/SoftwareList.md). This program is design to be easily customisable.

In the end, this script will also take a list of softwares you want to uninstall (usually pre-installed softwares are just a waste of space, so this will automate their uninstallation) and provide minor configurations for softwares installed (ie: deactivate root account for ssh connections,...).

See actual [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for the list of implemented features.
