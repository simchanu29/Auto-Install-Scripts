The following [file](SoftwareList.md) contains the list of softwares which will be automatically installed.

If you don't want one of these, just untick the box in front of it. Unticked softwares will be purged from the system, if you don't want this, just remove them from the list.

You can also add some new ones, but they have to be hosted on the officials repository!

You shouldn't add softwares from self-hosted sources to this list!

For self-hosted softwares, the feature is upcoming.

Once it is done, just launch the autoInstall.sh file!
